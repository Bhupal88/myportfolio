			<b>Welcome to My Website!</b> <br>
			I am a dedicated and driven professional with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Sydney. My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in the principles and practices of IT, preparing me for the dynamic and ever-evolving tech industry.<br><br>
			During my studies, I interned as a Business Analyst at a leading SaaS company based in Sydney. This invaluable experience allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, enhancing my analytical skills and understanding of business processes.<br><br>
			I have a robust skill set that includes proficiency in programming languages such as Python and SQL. Additionally, I am well-versed in using powerful data visualization tools like PowerBI and Tableau. These skills enable me to transform complex data into actionable insights, a capability I have demonstrated through various projects and certifications, which you can explore on my Projects/Certifications page.<br><br>
			Thank you for visiting my website. I invite you to learn more about my journey, skills, and the projects I have undertaken.<br>
