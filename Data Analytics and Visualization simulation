/* This is a Forage project simulating data analytics and visualization in real world tasks */
The client has sent through:
•	7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
•	A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.

Based on the files given I'll be performing the following steps:
1. Requirements gathering
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data modelling

TASK1
The client wants us to clean the data removing missing values, changing data types of some values and removing irrelevant columns.
After merging the tables, the client wants to know the Top 5 performing categories.


TASK2
The client wants to understand the top 5 content categories. This will involve presenting the findings in an appropriate visualization charts.
Similarly, some other requests from the client:
•	How many unique categories are there?
•	How many reactions are there to the most popular category?
•	What was the month with the most posts?
